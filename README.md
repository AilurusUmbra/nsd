# Objectives

This course discusses how to organize code for numerical methods to solve
mathematical or physical problems in modern development processes. We will be
using the combination of bash, git, Python, C++, and related tools.

# Prerequisites

This is a graduate or senior level course open to all students who have taken
engineering mathematics or equivalence. Working knowledge of Linux and
Unix-like is required. Prior knowledge to numerical methods is recommended. The
instructor will use English to lecture and discuss.  Computer program homework
and projects should be developed against a Linux environment.

# Outline

1. Python and numpy: computing platform with data structures and helpers
2. C++ and computer architecture: high performance from hardware support
3. Fundamental engineering tools: automation
4. Memory management: host large problems and trade for speed
5. Matrix operations: fast data access with arrays and linear algebra
6. Cache optimization and SIMD: latency hiding and basic parallelism
7. Modern C++: more than just templates
8. Xtensor: arrays in C++
9. Pybind11 and cpython API: have Python and C++ to talk to each other
10. Cpython internals: how the open-source computing platform works
11. High-performance software design: data-centric system design
12. Hybrid code organization: manage the complexity of multi-languages
    implementation
